I would like to acknowledge all the people that have helped me with this research problem. First of all, I thank my academic advisor, prof. Kumazawa, for giving me a chance to live and study in Japan, and for his support during my research. 
I would also like to thank other member of my laboratory, especially Fukushi-san and Matsumura san, as well as recently graduated Quivy-san, for their help in discussing my work and assisting me in data collection, and just for being good friends. 
I recognize that this research would not have been possible without the financial assistance of Japanâ€™s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), to which I express my gratitude.

Also, I want to thank my family, especially my grandmother who has raised and always supported me, my mother, whose initiative has made my study here possible, and my brother, who has always helped me in tight spots. 

Last, but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to Hirasawa Makiko and Saeko, who has provided me home away from home in Japan, and without whose moral support I'd have never made it so far.
